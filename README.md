# Insurance Policy App

## Project Description
The Insurance Policy App is a web application that allows users to manage and view insurance policies, clients, and agents. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing various aspects of insurance policies and related data.

## Features

- **Policy Management:** Add, update, and delete insurance policies with details such as policy type, start and end dates, premium amounts, and more.

- **Client Management:** Manage client information including personal details, contact information, and policies associated with each client.

- **Agent Management:** Maintain a database of agents, their contact details, and policies they manage.

- **Search and Filter:** Easily search, filter, and sort policies, clients, and agents based on various criteria.

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization system to protect sensitive data and manage user access.

- **Sanitization:** The application implements sanitization techniques to prevent any malicious inputs and ensure data security.

## How to Log In
